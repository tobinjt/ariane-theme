Plan for website:

*   We need a Cart66 replacement sooner or later; either migrate to their hosted
    offering or find a similar solution.  Probably use Shopify,
    https://www.shopify.com/lite
*   https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/sell-online/buy-button/add-embed-code#add-script-tags-separately
*   Add the Javascript to all the product pages.
*   Generate the data Shopify needs for each product; it's very verbose, dunno
    how repetitive or how different it is, only time will tell.
*   Add compatibility code so that I can set up all the Shopify stuff and enable
    it later.
*   Profit?
