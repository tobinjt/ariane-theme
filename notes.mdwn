## How are images included in the slider?

The image description needs to start with 'slider ', and be followed by a URL;
the image will link to that URL.  The image needs to have width and height
attributes, which are probably automatically added by Wordpress when you upload
it, and also have an attachment URL, but I don't know why I added that check.

## How do I download a new version of Cart66?

Go to https://buy.cart66.com/, login, click on the order number in the order
history table, then click on the cart66-pro.zip link.  Copy it to hosting and
rename it to include the version number.
